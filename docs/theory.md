# Distributed Systems Theory

## REST Architecture Principles

### 1. Stateless
- **Definition**: Each request contains all information needed to process it
- **Implementation**: No session data stored on server between requests
- **Benefits**: Improved scalability, reliability, and visibility

### 2. Client-Server
- **Definition**: Clear separation between client and server responsibilities
- **Implementation**: Coordinator and worker have distinct roles
- **Benefits**: Improved portability and scalability

### 3. Cacheable  
- **Definition**: Responses indicate whether they can be cached
- **Implementation**: GET requests return cacheable data
- **Benefits**: Improved network efficiency and performance

### 4. Uniform Interface
- **Definition**: Standardized communication methods
- **Implementation**: HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with consistent semantics
- **Benefits**: Simplified architecture and improved interoperability

### 5. Layered System
- **Definition**: Architecture composed of hierarchical layers
- **Implementation**: Coordinator can manage multiple workers
- **Benefits**: Improved scalability and flexibility

## Distributed Computing Concepts

### Service Discovery
- **Problem**: How do services find and communicate with each other?
- **Solution**: Automatic worker registration with coordinator
- **Implementation**: Workers send registration requests on startup

### Load Balancing
- **Problem**: How to distribute work efficiently across multiple workers?
- **Solution**: Coordinator implements round-robin task assignment
- **Benefits**: Improved performance and resource utilization

### Fault Tolerance
- **Problem**: How to handle service failures gracefully?
- **Solution**: Coordinator falls back to local processing when workers unavailable
- **Implementation**: Try-catch blocks with graceful degradation

### Scalability
- **Problem**: How to handle increasing load?
- **Solution**: Horizontal scaling by adding more worker nodes
- **Implementation**: Dynamic worker registration and load distribution

## Network Communication

### HTTP Protocol
- **Advantages**: Widely supported, human-readable, stateless
- **Implementation**: All service communication uses HTTP/HTTPS
- **Methods Used**: GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (remove)

### JSON Data Format
- **Advantages**: Lightweight, human-readable, language-independent
- **Implementation**: All API requests and responses use JSON
- **Validation**: Pydantic models ensure data integrity

### Asynchronous Processing
- **Advantages**: Non-blocking operations, improved performance
- **Implementation**: FastAPI async/await patterns
- **Use Cases**: Worker registration, task delegation, health checks

## Consistency Models

### Eventual Consistency
- **Definition**: System will become consistent over time
- **Implementation**: Worker statistics eventually propagate to coordinator
- **Trade-offs**: Improved availability vs immediate consistency

### Strong Consistency
- **Definition**: All reads receive the most recent write
- **Implementation**: Database operations on coordinator
- **Use Cases**: University and course management

## CAP Theorem

In our system:
- **Consistency**: Database operations are consistent
- **Availability**: Services remain available even if workers fail
- **Partition Tolerance**: System continues operating despite network issues

**Choice**: We prioritize **Availability** and **Partition Tolerance** over strict consistency for distributed operations.

## Performance Considerations

### Latency
- **Sources**: Network communication, database queries, processing time
- **Optimization**: Local caching, async operations, efficient queries
- **Monitoring**: Response time tracking and statistics

### Throughput
- **Measurement**: Requests per second, tasks processed per minute
- **Scaling**: Add more workers to increase processing capacity
- **Bottlenecks**: Database queries, network bandwidth, worker capacity

### Reliability
- **Strategies**: Health checks, error handling, graceful degradation
- **Monitoring**: Service uptime, error rates, response times
- **Recovery**: Automatic worker re-registration, fallback processing

## Real-World Applications

This architecture pattern is used in:
- **Microservices**: Netflix, Amazon, Google
- **Cloud Computing**: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions
- **Distributed Databases**: MongoDB, Cassandra
- **Web Applications**: Social media platforms, e-commerce sites
